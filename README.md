# gravi-tako üêôüåô

(Pronounced like gravity, not like gravy)

Submission for the Acerola Game Jam 0! Theme: Aberration - That which deviates from normal.

So I thought... How would a 3D platformer without gravity would work? One where you're truly free to move on every surface, direction and orientation.

The result of that experimentation is this... the gravi-tako!

Move, jump, shoot yourself through the air and explore the little sandbox I created for you!

There is no objective to the game, as I had no time to implement collectables or something. But you're free to explore a kind of game that is not commonly seen... and that's for a reason. Many people report getting dizzy playing this, so beware!

The game was made on godot 4.2.1 and tested on Windows 11 and Macos Sonoma.

Everything else was made by me, from 0 during the game jam, or in the case of the cell shader, made by me a few weeks before.
